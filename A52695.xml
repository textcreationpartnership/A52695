            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>HOW SIN IS STRENGTHNED And how it is OVERCOME.</head>
            <p>THat Sin is in the world, and that all are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by become children of wrath, is generally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved and confeſſed by all; but how ſin is ſtrengthned in men and women againſt God and their own ſouls, or how it is overcome, ſew there be that doth, I do here declare ſomewhat of that which I have received from him, who is faithful and true in all his teſtimony.</p>
            <p>And this I find, that as ſin got rooting at firſt through luſt, ſo till this day it hath its ſtrength, by the deſires going forth to affect or luſt after ſomthing whether ſpiritual, or carnal, above, before, or beſides what that eternal ſpirit by which man was created, doth communicate to him, or beget in him; for the eye of the Lilly being blinded by the

god of this World, which eye ſhould look unto God for all; there is an eye of unbelief open, which looks into the viſibles and gives occaſion for the luſt to conceive in the mind, affections and deſires, after ſomething which the ſpirit of God leads not to, for the obtaining whereof all the power and wiſdom that is in man is ſet on work, and this becomes ſin both in the deſires and actions, and the more it is followed, the ſtronger it is; for whatever is hereby obtained, becomes a treaſure of wickedneſſe, laid up in the habitation of the wicked one, whereby the luſt is increaſed, and the ſeed of God burthened, and buried, whereby the creature becom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s daily more unſenſible of the Will of God, and the movings of that pure ſpirit which ſhould keep the creature alive to the Creator, and draw the mind wholly up to the Father, on him alone to wait for a ſupply in all things, both for ſoul and body: and every deſire that ſprings from this root being ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to go forth deſiles the man, and brings in that which oppreſſeth the juſt, untill by continuance man grows into the nature of the enmity, and the imaginations of the heart becomes wholly evill, and that which ſhould give the knowledge of God wholly buried, and in many that which ſhould give the knowledge of ſin alſo, whereby man becomes paſt ſeeling, utterly dead in ſins and treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes heaped upon the juſt againſt the day of Judgment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which becomes by cuſtom as natural to commit as to the Ox to drink water; yea with greedineſſe doth man in this condition hunt after his own deſtruction, having damn'd up the way of life in himſelfe by often tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it, and is become degenerate from the nature of God, having received in, and willingly joyned to that nature of Satan, which as a leaven hath and doth work into its own nature all that receive it or yeild unto it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whom as they grow therein, there ſprings up fruits of the ſame root and nature which they bring forth in his
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:44348:2"/>
time and opportunity with liking and delight, being fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with all ſubtilty to colour them over, and plead for them, being in covenant and agreement with ſin, ſome in one thing, and ſome in another, every one pleading the allowance of that ſin with God, which moſt ſutes their preſent luſts, pride, profit or pleaſure, credit or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem in the World, or ſome ſelf-end<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and at theſe they take counſel, and not at the ſpirit of the Lord, what is ſin, and what is no ſin, but none will believe that they can be ſet free from all ſin, by him who teſtifies againſt all ſin in ſpirit; and in all theſe the man of ſin hath his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom by conſent, for they being willing to keep covenant with him in one evil, are guilty of all.</p>
            <p>Now the way to overcome all this, and him that hath his power therein, is by faith in Chriſt Jeſus the light and life, and way to the Father; for without believing there can be no victory; but in the faithful following of him, and patient bearing his croſſe and enduring his ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, comes the enmity to be ſlain, <hi>captivity led captive,</hi> and man ſet at liberty, in the holy ſeed, to ſerve the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in ſpirit and life again.</p>
            <p>And firſt, Chriſt as he is the light of the world muſt be believed, for ſo he comes to manifeſt and reprove the deeds of darkneſs, and to open judgement and to give a diſcerning, and to make a ſeparation between the works of God, and the works of the devil, in the mind and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the creature, and to let them ſee what ſpirit doth exerciſe their minds and affections, and the fruits of each ſpirit, and the moving and working of each ſpirit ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, without which none can rightly know what is to be deſtroyed and what ſaved: what to joyne to; and what to war againſt: for by this light alone comes man to the knowledge of ſin in himſelfe, in the ground and root of it, and every motion thereof: for though the letter or ſomething without, may ſhew what is ſin by its fruits
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:44348:3"/>
when it is brought forth, yet its the work of the ſpirit within to diſcover ſpiritual wickedneſſe in its firſt moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is the onely place to kill it ere it become ſin to the creature; and this light muſt be believed, and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently minded all along, for ſuch is the ſubtilty of the enemy, having got power over the will and ſences of man, that he will ſet them to war againſt the creature, and deſtroy the Creation rather then that of his which defiles the creature, and this cannot be avoided any other way but by minding the light of Chriſt, to ſeparate that which is but to be cleanſed, from that which is to be deſtroyed, and this man cannot do without the ſpirit, being a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual work, though he never ſo much ſeeks after it: And here is the cauſe why many are kept at hard labour all their time, and never come clear out of ſin and unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, even not believing in that which hath the power to ſeparate and lead out of the evil, but without the ſingle eye are at work in the dark, and ſees not a clear ſeparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the body: And hence it is that ſome deſtroy them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in ſeeking to deſtroy ſin, not minding the light of the Saviour is led by the deſtroyer, fighting againſt that which Chriſt comes to ſave, whileſt he that comes to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy lies hid in the dark: But he that believes in that which manifeſts all things, reproves all things and jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges all things, with that eye ſhall be led what to war a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt and what to joyn with all-along in the work, for he alone is the covenant of light, and given for a leader, which whoſoever believes and follows, ſhall not erre in judgement or practice, but unbelief therein is the cauſe why there are ſo many blind guids, and many people die in their ſins for want of this faith and ſpirituall dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence.</p>
            <p>And thus he is the way of God, and is to be believed in, (to wit) as he manifeſts the works of the Devil a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from the works of God, condemning the one in the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:44348:3"/>
fleſh, and juſtifying the other in the ſpirit, and as he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſts every ſpirit with its workings, motions, and ends, their ground and off-ſpring whence they come, and whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they return, that thereby the creature may know who it is that exerciſes his mind and members, and to what ſpirit he yeelds himſelfe in his obedience and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and ſo may come to know the uſe and end of all his works, what to chuſe, and what to refuſe, what to juſtifie and what condemn in its firſt motion, before it be brought forth or formed in the womb, that judgement may be kept on the head of tranſgreſſion, and liberty proclaimed to the Juſt: and for want of faith and feeling of this way of Chriſt it is that ſo many periſh in ſin, and yet ſeem to ſtrive againſt ſin, even becauſe they cannot believe that to be ſufficient to ſave from ſin which manifeſts ſin in the ground, and condemns it in its firſt motion, which if they did but in faith and diligence joyn with him to condemn ſin in the ground, temptation, and motion, it would dye, and wither, and not be able long to live or prevaile; and if it for a time ſhould live in the members, yet not to condemnation; for I have found a great difference between ſin condemned in the creature (though not yet wholly dead) and ſin lived in, and pleaded for; for if thy life and judgement be in that alone which condemns ſin, then art thou dead to ſin, and alive to Chriſt, and it is no more thou that ſins, but ſin that yet remains in thee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to which thou art dead, to which thou doſt not conſent, like, nor approve of, nor any way add any ſtrength thereto; but thy faith and love, delight and ſtrength is in him which condemns it; he that is truly in this faith and love, by the working thereof ſhall all his enemies periſh, and by that faith and love ſhall the juſt live in that creature, and he in him condemning and killing ſin till it all be done away, and the creature of God ſound alive in him alone<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who without ſpot will
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:44348:4"/>
preſent him to the Father; for this I have found, that, that which manifeſts ſin in its firſt motion, judges it there, and condemns it there, hath the onely power to kill ſin ere it be committed, and ſo hath onely power to ſave from condemnation; for this you ſhall find, that as Chriſt doth not live to juſtification, where he is not believed and juſtified, loved, followed, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed: though in ſuch he move, ſo ſin doth not live to condemnation where it is hated, condemned, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed; for where that ſpirit of wickedneſſe is ſeen in the light, and ſeparated from, and judged apart from the creature, the creature joyning in judgement with juſt, there ſin will wither, and <hi>Satan</hi> flee, for there he hath no kingdome, nor a hiding <hi>Habitation;</hi> for the light being minded, and judgement having free paſſage and conſent, it ſearcheth out his hidden things, and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment paſſeth upon all his deceit, root and ground, with his fruits; ſo is the ſtrong man ſpoyled, and his ſtuff, by faith in Chriſt and not by ſtrength of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, by beleeving the juſt, and denying the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt.</p>
            <p>For according to every mans <hi>Faith,</hi> ſo ſhall he receive from God; now he that beleeves <hi>ſalvation</hi> and that cleaves to, and lives in ſome ſin, and pleads for it, and beleeves he muſt do ſo, his <hi>Faith</hi> ſtands in an uncleane thing, and an unclean thing will live by that <hi>Faith,</hi> and be juſtified by that <hi>Creature,</hi> and in his juſtifying any thing that is uncleane, therein is the juſt condemned (and that <hi>Faith</hi> cannot be counted to that <hi>Creature</hi> for righteouſneſſe) and the juſt being condemned which ſhould give dominion over the <hi>unclean,</hi> the wilde <hi>Plant</hi> hath its liberty to grow until it overſpread the <hi>Plant</hi> of God and cover the man, wholly ſtop the ear, and blind the eye, and hardens the heart againſt every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to good, or check for evil; and let not this
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:44348:4"/>
man look for good fruit, but after his <hi>Faith</hi> who ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves.</p>
            <p>Alſo, on the contrary: He that feels a ſtrife in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe between the clean and the unclean, and ſees the one reproove for ſin, and the other plead for ſin, and believes in that which is pure, clean and juſt, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns the unjuſt and unclean, that faith ſtands in that which is pure, and the myſtery and power of it is held in a pure conſcience; and that pure faith being follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, will purifie the heart, and cleanſe the hands from unjuſt actions; and by that faith the juſt lives, and grows, and ſprings, and brings forth, and the pure plant ſpreads and covers the earth with the knowledge of God, his holineſſe, power and purity, and all grace in the heart, which becomes as a working leaven till it hath wrought out the unclean nature and conformed the whole man to himſelfe: And this is a work of the holy faith, which none can receive but who believes in holineſſe; for none can bring clean fruit out of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean faith.</p>
            <p>And this further, for the incouragement of ſuch as honeſtly indeed would be rid of their ſin, and ſet free to ſerve God in holineſſe without deceit; thou feeling in thee the moving of that which is holy bearing wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe againſt that which is contrary to holineſſe, and condemning it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and thee for joyning with it in all thy converſation: I ſay, in that beleeve for that is all thou knows of Chriſt in thee, and believing and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, thou wilt feele it making a ſeparation in thy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man, betwixt that which Chriſt comes to ſave<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that which he comes to deſtroy; for this is he that comes from above to ſet before thee life and death divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that thou joyning to the life, and believing may be ſaved from death; and as thou art faithful to this ſpirit which condemns ſin in the fleſh, ſo thou wilt feel
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:44348:5"/>

            <p>THere is a way in which the barren becomes fruitful, and a little is more ſerviceable to God then he that hath great <hi>riches</hi> for himſelf; you that ſees your wants are nigh it, and the lowly mind will ſooneſt follow it; and for the honeſt-hearted it is prepared, who ſeeks to ſerve God, and not your ſelves. If you take heed to your own wayes, and make nothing in your minds, you muſt not create that which muſt ſtand before God; for he will be ſerved with his own begettings in you. Take heed therefore you make nothing to your ſelves, nor mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that which he freely begets; but let your minds be alwayes heavenly, waiting with patience in that which lets you ſee your wants, therewith that your hearts may be open alwayes upward towards God the father of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very good giſt; and you being hid in the Heavenly mind from that nature which compaſſeth the Earth in its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions, and would compaſſe Heaven alſo, &amp; wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a croſs to that mind, as you come into the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſtilneſſe, you will feel the begettings of the Father moving in you to be brought forth, to which you muſt become ſervants, ſetting aſide all ſubtilty, and that which is haſty, and what ever is your own, or hath an end to your ſelves, and in the pure mind behold what way this moves its appearance againſt the worldly ſpirit, that with your whole hearts and might you may bring it forth in its own image, without reaſoning or conſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with any thing of your own, or any thing of this world, for this ariſes in a contrary nature to that which is one with the world; bears another image and fruit, &amp; hath another glory in its appearance, in which the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

alone is glorified, even in this his Son of his own free begetting; and herein is the Father glorified, that he be brought forth with his fruits into the world who thereby is known how far he is above and contrary to the worldly ſpirit, both in the ground, root, and off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring.</p>
            <p>And whoſoever will give up themſelves to ſerve him herein, by his encreaſe ſhall become rich towards God, and encreaſe in ſtrength dayly againſt the world; and by bringing forth, and by his beauty in holineſſe, ſhall become glorious and beloved in the ſight of the Father, whoſe image &amp; begetting they bear, wherein they ſhall become Heirs of the eternall glory.</p>
            <p>But if you look into the earthly mind, there the world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpirit meets you with his counſel, and conſulting and reaſoning therewith, you take counſel in the night, from which the counſel of God is hid, his work, the end and glory thereof, and inſtead of that, you will be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented with the pleaſure, and glory of this world, which ſtands in viſible things and is pleaſing to the viſible eye and ſences, which glory the God of this world ſees in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and leads into, in which his wiſdom and knowledge ſtands, which cannot enter into the inviſible glory and treaſure: And in this ſpirit that knows not God, nor his works, nor ſeeks his glory, will you meet with the thief and murtherer, ſons of darkneſſe, who will perſwade you ſtrongly to murther the pure motion, and not to bring it forth, or elſe ſo to bring it forth as that the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage thereof may be marred, as not to bear its clear and perfect teſtimony againſt the worlds Kingdom, Power and Glory; and this you cannot avoyd if you look back into his counſel, and conſult with your own reaſonings, wherein ariſes thoughts, cares and pleaſures out of the world, which cumbers the mind, choaks the ſeed, and kills the holy childe, and covers the Pearl with earthly

affections &amp; luſts, which continually hardens the heart, and ſtrengthens the will againſt the innocent, and ſo puts the juſt to death in the womb, for want of bringing forth in its time, and according to its motion, which when you have rejected, you cannot beget again of your ſelves, nor in your own wills, though you may <hi>procure the likeneſs of it from another ſpirit in that nature which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts the truth, and corrupts the mind,</hi> and brings forth in its own will to gainſay, as ſome have done, who having diſobeyed the ſtill motion of a meek ſpirit, and looking for high things, God hath given them up to a lofty ſpirit, and ſtrong workings in a contrary nature, who now have a power wherewith to reſiſt that which firſt begot them out of the World, and a moving ſpirit which draws towards the world again, which being got into the place of God (as God) makes them believe that their return is of the ſame ſpirit that called them out, to which they yielding the ſame obedience, thenceforth without fear becomes the ſame they were, if not ſeven-fold worſe, without hope of recovery: and this diſobedience be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes as witchcraft.</p>
            <p>Wherefore in the fear of God, watch with all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, hearken in the ſimplicity of your hearts, and take heed that you ſlip not any time of hearings, nor prove falſe in your conception or bringing forth, but that both calling and election may be made ſure to you, not onely by being in the knowledge of it, but alſo by bringing it forth, that it may be your own for ever: for that which you bring forth is your inheritance, and none can take it from you, but you have power therein againſt all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary ſpirits, which whileſt it is but in the motion, will ſtrongly tempt and ſeek the life thereof to ſtifle: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brought forth, it is before you, and onely ſo it is put on as a breſt plate, and becomes a defence, and ſets you over the head of the evil one: which being begot,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:44348:8"/>
and not brought forth, it withers, and becomes as dry bones in the womb.</p>
            <p>Therefore as you muſt give your minds wholly to hearken, ſo muſt you give your ſtrength wholly to obey; and when you feel the pure to move in you, with your whole ſtrength ſerve it, and bring it forth, give up your bodies a ſacrifice ſor his ſake whom you have not ſeen, that his life may be made manifeſt in your mortall fleſh, and through you to the World, that he may be ſeen in his brightneſſe to all that love him, and before his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: then is the body for the Lord, and not for fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: But if you reſt in the knowledge of this myſtery, and bring not forth to life, with that knowledge you commit fornication and teach others to commit forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation alſo, this knowledge in the diſobedient mind be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the mother of harlots, and fornications of the earth, with which the Kings of the earth are deceived, but none ever joyned to God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For it is not the hearing of the truth that purifies the ſoul, but the obedience of truth which makes the Veſſel fit for the Maſters uſe, who in his uſing, and its obedience makes it a veſſel of honour, and glorifies his Son therein, in a body prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to do the Fathers will in the world, whereby the Father is glorified in the Son, in whom he ſhines forth in the clear image as the Father begets him again in you, and you in him, which was in him before the World was, of his own nature and good will, which as you conceive again by faith and obedience, you will be changed into the ſame image and nature, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light onely therein, being born of the ſame ſpirit, as he that is born of the fleſh delights in the things of the fleſh.</hi>
